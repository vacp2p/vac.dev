Discussion on the conversion of interactive protocols to noninteractive protocols.
<!--truncate-->

## Blog - Fiat-Shamir Heuristics

Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are often presented as interactive protocols.
In interactive protocols, the Prover and the Verifier are in active communication.
However, this is not practical for many applications.
For decentralized systems, it is necessary for the Prover to produce a proof on their own that any party can verify.
To achieve this, it is necessary for the Prover to produce the Verifier's messages in such a way that the Prover cannot manipulate these messages.
The [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/36664.36676) is used for this purpose.
In this document, we provide a discussion on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, and known pitfalls of its application.

### Cryptographic (?) Hash Functions
We begin by reviewing the properties of cryptographic hash functions.
A hash function $H$ is a special function that takes in an arbitrary binary string and outputs a bit string of a constant length.
Specifically,
$H : \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$.

Informally, a cryptographic hash function $H$ satisfies the following properties:
- **Succinct**: The hash $H({\bf{b}})$ can be efficiently computed for any binary string ${\bf{b}}$.
- **Preimage Resistance**: Let ${\bf{y}}$ be a binary string of length $n$.
    It should be 'impossible' to find some binary string ${\bf{x}}$ so that ${\bf{y}} = H({\bf{x}})$. 
- **Collision Resistance**: It should be 'impossible' to find two binary strings ${\bf{x}_1}$ and ${\bf{x}_2}$ so that $H({\bf{x}_1}) = H({\bf{x}_2}).$

Commonly used hash functions include SHA256, Keccak, and Poseidon.

### Improper Use of Fiat-Shamir?

A subtle but serious issue that can occur in the application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic has been a point of discussion for the past few years.
Auditors from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) and [OpenZepellin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) have released blogs (TODO-CITATIONS) and papers (TODO-CITATIONS) describing specific vunerabilities in zero-knowledge papers and repositories associated to improper application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristics.
In a theoretical sense, a system is vunerable to a malicious Prover when the Verifier's challenges are simulated using weak Fiat-Shamir.
In a much more understandable sense, the challenges are generated without fixing all of the values (especially the public parameters).

Trail of Bits coined this vunerability as **FROZEN Heart**.
Frozen comes from the phrase "FoRging Of ZEro kNoledge proofs",
and Fiat-Shamir is the "heart" of transforming an interactive protocol to non-interactive procotol.

#### Example 1 - The Schnorr Protocol
The Schnorr protocol is the simplest interactive protocol the vunerability of applying weak Fiat-Shamir.

TODO-add motivation for Schnorr protocol

|Prover| | Verifier|
|----|----|----|
|$t \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$, $T := g^t$|    |    |
|    | $T \rightarrow$| |
|  |  | $c \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$|
|  | $\leftarrow c$ |
| $z := t + xc$ | | |
| | $z \rightarrow$ | |
| | | output 1 provided $g^z == T X^c$|

TODO - more explanation

When the strong Fiat-Shamir heuristics is applied,
the challenge $c = Hash(g|X|T)$.
This choice of $c$ provides security since it should be 'impossible' to find collisions for the outputs of $Hash$.
Thus, $c$ fixes the group elements $g$, $X$ and $T$.

Note that the elements that would be neglected in applying weak Fiat-Shamir are $g$ and $X$.
Now, we examine a couple variations of applying weak Fiat-Shamir.

#### Example 1 - Approach 1
In this first approach, we will omit the generator $g \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the challenge $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(X,T)$.

A malicious Prover completes the transcript for the Schnorr protocol by selecting any $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
At this point, the generator $g$ has not been selected.
But, the malicious Prover needs the transcript $(T,c,z)$ to satisfy $g^z == TX^c$.
Hence, the malicious Prover takes $g = (TX^c)^{z^{-1}}.$

#### Example 1 - Approach 2
In our second approach, we omit the public address $X \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the challenge $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(g,T)$.

As with the previous example, the malicious Prover takes a Schnorr transcript $(T,c,z)$ where $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
It is necessary for the malicious Prover to find a value $X$ so that $g^z == TX^c$.
This can be acheived by taking $X = (g^z T^{-1})^{c^{-1}}$.
