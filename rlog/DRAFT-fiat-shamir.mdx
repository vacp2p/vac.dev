In this post, provide a discussion on a common technique used to convert interactive protocols to their noninteractive variant.
<!--truncate-->

## Introduction

The set of interactive protocols form a class of protocols that consist of communication between two parties: the Prover and the Verifier.
The Prover tries to convince the Verifier of a given claim.
For example, the Prover may want to convince the Verifier that she owns a specific UTXO;
that is, the Prover possesses the ability to spend the UTXO.
In many instances, there is information that the Prover does not wish to reveal to the Verifier.
In our example, it is critical that the Prover does not provide the Verifier with the spending key associated to her UTXO.
In addition to the Prover's claim and secret data, there is additional data, public parameters, that the claimed statement is expressed in terms of.
The public parameters can be thought of as the basis for all similar claims.

In an interactive protocol, the Prover and the Verifier are in active communication.
Specifically, the Prover and the Verifier exchange messages so that the Verifier can validate the Prover's claim.
However, this communication is not practical for many applications.
It is necessary that any party can verify the Prover's claim in decentralized systems.
It is impractical for the Prover to be in active communication with a large number of verifying parties.
Instead, it is desirable for the Prover to generate a proof on their own that can convince any party.
To achieve this, it is necessary for the Prover to generate the Verifier's messages in such a way that the Prover cannot manipulate the Verifier's messages for her benefit.
The [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/36664.36676) is used for this purpose.

## Hash Functions
Cryptographic hash functions serve as the backbone to the Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
A hash function, $\mathsf{Hash}$, is a special function that takes in an arbitrary binary string and outputs a binary string of a predetermined fixed length.
Specifically,
$\mathsf{Hash} : \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$.

A cryptographic hash function satisfies the following properties:
- **Succinct**: The hash function should be easy to compute; the hash $\mathsf{Hash}({\bf{b}})$ can be efficiently computed for any binary string ${\bf{b}}$.
- **Preimage Resistance**: It should be impossible to work backwards given the output of a hash function. Let ${\bf{y}}$ be a binary string of length $n$.
    It should be 'impossible' to find some binary string ${\bf{x}}$ so that ${\bf{y}} = \mathsf{Hash}({\bf{x}})$. 
- **Collision Resistance**: It should be difficult to find two strings that hash to the same value. It should be 'impossible' to find two binary strings ${\bf{x}_1}$ and ${\bf{x}_2}$ so that $\mathsf{Hash}({\bf{x}_1}) = \mathsf{Hash}({\bf{x}_2}).$

Commonly used hash functions include SHA256, Keccak, and Poseidon.

## The Fiat-Shamir heuristic
The Fiat-Shamir heuristic is the technique used to convert an interactive protocol to a noninteractive protocol.
This is done by replacing the Verifier's messages with hash values.
Specifically, the Prover generates the Verifier's message evaluating a hash function $\mathsf{Hash}$ on the concatenation of all values exchanged thus far in the protocol.
If $m_0, \dots, m_t$ denote the public values in the protocol thus far,
then the Verifier's message is computed as $m_{t+1} := \mathsf{Hash}(m_0|| \cdots || m_t)$.

Since $\mathsf{Hash}$ can be efficiently computed, and the messages $m_0, \dots, m_t$ are public, then any verifying party can compute $m_{t+1}$.
Critically, since $\mathsf{Hash}$ is preimage resistant and collision resistant,
the Prover cannot manipulate her choices of messages $m_0,\dots, m_t$ to 'predict' $m_{t+1}$.
Hence, verifying parties can trust that $m_{t+1}$ is sufficiently random with respect to the preceding messages.

### Improper use of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic

The Fiat-Shamir heuristic appears to be a fairly straight-forward technique to implement.
However, a subtle but serious issue that can occur in the application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic has been a point of discussion for the past few years.
The issue concerns what messages are included in the hash.
In particular, are the public parameters used to compute the hash value?

Bernhard et al. ([11](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/771.pdf)) provide a discussion of Fiat-Shamir heuristic resticted to $\Sigma$-protocols.
Bernhard et al. define two variants of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic: weak and strong.
The strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic requires that the public parameters are included in the calculations of the Verifier's messages while the weak version does not.
The values included in the evaluation of the hash fixes them throughout the protocol.
This means that the Prover cannot retroactively change them.

The issue of weak vs strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic has persisted since Bernhard et al.'s paper. 
In recent years, auditors from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) and [OpenZepellin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) have 
released blogs ([2](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/13/part-1-coordinated-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-affecting-girault-bulletproofs-and-plonk/),
 [3](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/14/the-frozen-heart-vulnerability-in-giraults-proof-of-knowledge/),
 [4](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/15/the-frozen-heart-vulnerability-in-bulletproofs/), [5](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/18/the-frozen-heart-vulnerability-in-plonk/), [7](https://blog.openzeppelin.com/the-last-challenge-attack))
 and papers ([6](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/691), [8](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/398)) 
 describing specific vunerabilities in zero-knowledge papers and repositories associated to the use of the weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

Trail of Bits coined the term **FROZEN Heart** to describe the use of weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
Frozen comes from the phrase "FoRging Of ZEro kNoledge proofs",
and Fiat-Shamir is the "heart" of transforming an interactive protocol to noninteractive procotol.

#### Example 1 - The Schnorr Protocol
The Schnorr protocol ([9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/0-387-34805-0_22)) is the first example of a $\Sigma$-protocol that one studies.
Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a multiplicative group of prime order $p$.
The Schnorr protocol provides a framework that enables the Prover to convince the Verifier that: for a given $g, X \in \mathbb{G}$, the Prover possesses $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ so that $X = g^x$.
The Schnorr protocol proceeds as follows:

|Prover| | Verifier|
|----|----|----|
|$t \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$, $T := g^t$|    |    |
|    | $T \rightarrow$| |
|  |  | $c \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$|
|  | $\leftarrow c$ |
| $z := t + xc$ | | |
| | $z \rightarrow$ | |
| | | output 1 provided $g^z == T X^c$|

The Schnorr protocol can be used to convince the Verifier provided that the discrete logarithm is hard in $\mathbb{G}$.

When the strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic is applied, the message $c = Hash(g||X||T)$.
This choice of $c$ provides security since it should be 'impossible' to find collisions for the outputs of $\mathsf{Hash}$.
Thus, $c$ fixes the group elements $g$, $X$ and $T$.

Note that the elements that would be omitted in the hash by applying weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic are $g$ and $X$.
Next, we examine a couple variations of applying weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

##### Example 1 - Approach 1
In the first approach, we will omit the generator $g \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the message $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(X||T)$.

A malicious Prover completes the transcript for the Schnorr protocol by selecting any $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
At this point, the generator $g$ has not been selected.
But, the malicious Prover needs the transcript $(T,c,z)$ to satisfy $g^z == TX^c$.
Hence, the malicious Prover can compute the generator $g = (TX^c)^{z^{-1}}.$

##### Example 1 - Approach 2
In our second approach, we omit the group element $X \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the challenge $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(g,T)$.

As with the previous example, the malicious Prover takes a Schnorr transcript $(T,c,z)$ where $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
It is necessary for the malicious Prover to find a value $X$ so that $g^z == TX^c$.
This can be acheived by computing $X = (g^z T^{-1})^{c^{-1}}$.

#### Example 2 - Chaum-Pedersen protocol
TODO - motivation
We say that $(u,v,w)$ is a DH-triple if and only if there exists some $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ so that $V = g^x$ and $W = U^x$.
The Chaum-Pedersen protocol provides a framework that enables a Prover to convince a Verifier that she possesses such a $x$ for a claimed DH-triple $(U,V,W)$.
The Chaum-Pedersen protocol proceeds as follows:

|Prover| | Verifier|
|----|----|----|
|$t \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$, $T := g^t$, $S := U^t$|    |    |
|    | $T,S \rightarrow$| |
|  |  | $c \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$|
|  | $\leftarrow c$ |
| $z := t + xc$ | | |
| | $z \rightarrow$ | |
| | | output 1 provided $g^z == T V^c$, $U^z = SW^c$|

The message $c = Hash(g||U||V||W||T||S)$ when the Prover applies the strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
The properties of $\mathsf{Hash}$ fixes the generator $g$ and the Prover's statement $(U,V,W)$.

Now, we will examine the application of weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

##### Example 2 - weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic
The Verifier's message $c = Hash(T,S)$ when weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic is applied.
The Prover's triple $(U,V,W)$ and the generator $g$ are not fixed by $c$.
As such, a malicious Prover can generate values for $U,V,W$, and $g$ that satisfy the Verifier's identity checks.
In the case of a malicious Prover, $T$ and $S$ are randomly group elements instead of being computed using a value $t$ that the Prover selected.
This means a malicious Prover must randomly select the value $z$ as well.

Given the values that have been fixed so far, each of the Verifier's identities consist of two unknowns.
Hence, it is necessary to select one of these unknowns from each identity so that a malicious Prover can compute the last value.
For instances, suppose that the malicious Prover randomly selects $V$ and $W$.
The malicious Prover can compute $g = (T V^c)^{1/z}$ and $V = (SW^c)^{1/z}$.
Thus, the malicious Prover has a claimed statement $(U,V,W)$ for generator $g$ that passes the Verifier's identities using weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

The omission of any of the values $U,V,W,$ and $g$ in the computation of $c$ allows a malicious Prover to forge a proof.
