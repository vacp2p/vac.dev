Discussion on the conversion of interactive protocols to noninteractive protocols.
<!--truncate-->

## Introduction

Interactive protocols is a class of protocols that consist of two parties: the Prover and the Verifier.
The Prover tries to convince the Verifier of a given claim.
For example, the Prover may need to convince the Verifier that she owns a specific UTXO.
In many instances, there is information that the Prover does not wish to reveal to the Verifier.
For our example, it is critical that the Prover does not provide the Verifier with the private key associated to the UTXO.
In addition to the Prover's claim and secret data, there is additional data called public parameters that the claimed data is given in terms of.
The public parameters can be thought of as the basis for all similar claims.

In interactive protocols, the Prover and the Verifier are in active communication.
Specifically, the Prover and the Verifier exchange messages so that the Verifier can validate the Prover's claim.
This communication is not practical for many applications.
In decentralized systems, it is necessary that the Prover produces proofs on their own that any party can verify.
To achieve this, it is necessary for the Prover to generate the Verifier's messages in such a way that the Prover cannot manipulate the Verifier's messages for her benefit.
The [Fiat-Shamir heuristic](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/36664.36676) is used for this purpose.
In this document, we provide a discussion on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, and known pitfalls of its application.

### Hash Functions
We begin by reviewing the properties of cryptographic hash functions.
A hash function $H$ is a special function that takes in an arbitrary binary string and outputs a bit string of a constant length.
Specifically,
$H : \{0,1\}^* \rightarrow \{0,1\}^n$.

Informally, a cryptographic hash function $H$ satisfies the following properties:
- **Succinct**: The hash $H({\bf{b}})$ can be efficiently computed for any binary string ${\bf{b}}$.
- **Preimage Resistance**: Let ${\bf{y}}$ be a binary string of length $n$.
    It should be 'impossible' to find some binary string ${\bf{x}}$ so that ${\bf{y}} = H({\bf{x}})$. 
- **Collision Resistance**: It should be 'impossible' to find two binary strings ${\bf{x}_1}$ and ${\bf{x}_2}$ so that $H({\bf{x}_1}) = H({\bf{x}_2}).$

Commonly used hash functions include SHA256, Keccak, and Poseidon.

### The Fiat-Shamir heuristic
The Fiat-Shamir heuristic is the technique used to convert an interactive protocol to a noninteractive protocol.
This is done by replacing the Verifier's messages with hash values.
Specifically, the Prover generates the Verifier's message evaluating a hash function $H$ on the concatenation of all values exchanged thus far in the protocol.
If $m_0, \dots, m_t$ denote the public values in the protocol thus far,
then the Verifier's message is computed as $m_{t+1} := H(m_0|| \cdots || m_t)$.

Since $H$ can be efficiently computed, and the messages $m_0, \dots, m_t$ are public, then any verifying party can compute $m_{t+1}$.
Critically, since $H$ is preimage resistant and collision resistant,
the Prover cannot manipulate her choices of messages $m_0,\dots, m_t$ to 'predict' $m_{t+1}$.
Hence, verifying parties can trust that $m_{t+1}$ is sufficiently random with respect to the preceding messages.

### Improper use of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic

The Fiat-Shamir heuristic appears to be a fairly straight-forward technique to implement.
However, a subtle but serious issue that can occur in the application of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic has been a point of discussion for the past few years.
The issue concerns what messages are included in the hash.
In particular, are the public parameters used to compute the hash value?

Bernhard et al. [11](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/771.pdf) provide a discussion of Fiat-Shamir heuristic resticted to $\Sigma$-protocols.
Bernhard et al. define two variants of the Fiat-Shamir heuristic: weak and strong.
The strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic requires that the public parameters are included in the calculations of the Verifier's messages while the weak version does not.
The values included in the evaluation of the hash fixes them throughout the protocol.
This means that the Prover cannot retroactively change them.

The issue of weak vs strong Fiat-Shamir heuristic has persisted since Bernhard et al.'s paper. 
In recent years, auditors from [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com/) and [OpenZepellin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) have 
released blogs ([2](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2022/04/13/part-1-coordinated-disclosure-of-vulnerabilities-affecting-girault-bulletproofs-and-plonk/),

 and papers ([6](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/691), [8](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/398)) 
 describing specific vunerabilities in zero-knowledge papers and repositories associated to the use of the weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.

Trail of Bits coined the term **FROZEN Heart** to describe the use of weak Fiat-Shamir heuristic.
Frozen comes from the phrase "FoRging Of ZEro kNoledge proofs",
and Fiat-Shamir is the "heart" of transforming an interactive protocol to non-interactive procotol.

#### Example 1 - The Schnorr Protocol
The Schnorr protocol is the simplest interactive protocol the vunerability of applying weak Fiat-Shamir.

TODO-add motivation for Schnorr protocol

|Prover| | Verifier|
|----|----|----|
|$t \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$, $T := g^t$|    |    |
|    | $T \rightarrow$| |
|  |  | $c \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$|
|  | $\leftarrow c$ |
| $z := t + xc$ | | |
| | $z \rightarrow$ | |
| | | output 1 provided $g^z == T X^c$|

TODO - more explanation

When the strong Fiat-Shamir heuristics is applied,
the challenge $c = Hash(g|X|T)$.
This choice of $c$ provides security since it should be 'impossible' to find collisions for the outputs of $Hash$.
Thus, $c$ fixes the group elements $g$, $X$ and $T$.

Note that the elements that would be neglected in applying weak Fiat-Shamir are $g$ and $X$.
Now, we examine a couple variations of applying weak Fiat-Shamir.

#### Example 1 - Approach 1
In this first approach, we will omit the generator $g \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the challenge $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(X,T)$.

A malicious Prover completes the transcript for the Schnorr protocol by selecting any $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
At this point, the generator $g$ has not been selected.
But, the malicious Prover needs the transcript $(T,c,z)$ to satisfy $g^z == TX^c$.
Hence, the malicious Prover takes $g = (TX^c)^{z^{-1}}.$

#### Example 1 - Approach 2
In our second approach, we omit the public address $X \in \mathbb{G}$ from the computation for the challenge $c$.
That is, $c = Hash(g,T)$.

As with the previous example, the malicious Prover takes a Schnorr transcript $(T,c,z)$ where $z \in_R \mathbb{Z}_p$.
It is necessary for the malicious Prover to find a value $X$ so that $g^z == TX^c$.
This can be acheived by taking $X = (g^z T^{-1})^{c^{-1}}$.
