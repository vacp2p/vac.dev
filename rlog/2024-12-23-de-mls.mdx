## Introduction

Secure Group Messaging (SGM) is resource-intensive when aiming for robust security features
like forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS).

One straightforward approach to SGM is a pairwise group chat,
where each pair of group members establishes a unique encryption key using Diffie-Hellman.
While this method ensures security, it falls short in terms of practicality:

- **High storage requirements**: Each participant must store encryption keys for every other participant.
- **Inefficient encryption**: Each message must be encrypted separately for every participant,
leading to significant computational overhead.
- **Inefficient message storage and delivery**: Each separately encrypted message must then be sent over the wire,
whatever this wire might be. Or stored in database.
- **Cumbersome group management**: Adding or removing users and refreshing keys becomes
increasingly inefficient as the group grows.

One scalable for Secure Group Messaging (SGM) is Message Layer Security (MLS), as standardized in [RFC 9420](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/).
Leveraging TreeKEM, MLS organizes group members in a cryptographic tree structure,
where each participant is responsible for maintaining specific parts of the tree.

In this post, we present the implementation details of the first version of Decentralized MLS (de-MLS)
which is an SGM protocol that satisfies the following features:

- Decentralized
- Scalable
- End-to-end encrypted (E2EE)
- FS and PCS provided
- Ethereum authenticated

## Background

### MLS

The Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol offers scalable and secure group messaging protocol
by organizing participants into a cryptographic tree structure,
enabling efficient operations like adding or removing members with logarithmic time complexity
relative to the group size. MLS provides strong security guarantees, including FS and PCS.

MLS assumes that two services are provided:

- An Authentication Service (AS): It enables group members to
authenticate the credentials presented by other group members.
- A Delivery Service (DS) that routes MLS messages among the
participants in the protocol in the correct order and manage the `keyPackage` of the users 
where the `keyPackage` is the objects that provide some public information about a user.

Despite its scalability, MLS has a notable limitation:
it is inherently designed for server-based federated architectures for delivery service (DS),
even when the servers themselves don't need to be trusted.
To achieve a decentralized protocol, the functionality of DS must be reimagined
to eliminate reliance on a central server while preserving the protocol's security properties.
Thus, we proposed decentralized MLS (de-MLS),
leveraging Waku nodes as peer-to-peer communication protocols to eliminate reliance on centralized servers.

Lastly, MLS operates on an epoch-based model,
where group state changes (e.g., adding/removing users or key refreshes) occur between epochs
that are always required to be conducted by a single entity.
For example, if a user is removed in epoch `E`,
the rest of the group members generate a new key in epoch `E + 1` by passing the new entropy.
The removed user cannot decrypt messages sent after epoch `E + 1`.

### Waku

[Waku](https://waku.org/) is a decentralized messaging protocol designed for secure and efficient communication in peer-to-peer networks.
It operates as a broadcast-based routing layer where content topics can be used to tag and filter messages.
Users join channels by subscribing to specific content topics,
which determine the scope and type of messages exchanged.
This enables flexible and efficient communication patterns in a decentralized environment.

## de-MLS

Decentralized MLS (de-MLS) is a peer-to-peer SGM protocol compatible with any P2P messaging application for the DS,
with Waku selected as the messaging protocol.
Decentralization is achieved not only at the delivery service (DS) level
but also within the authentication service (AS).
Multiple special nodes named Steward in the group serve as authorized identities to authenticate users
before they join or are removed from the group transparently.

de-MLS provides two different user management configurations, both utilizing the Waku protocol for DS:

1. **Single Steward**:
    - A single authorized identity (Steward) manages the group,
    including removing or adding users with agreement among users by a voting-based consensus.
2. **Multi-Steward**:
    - Multiple Stewards have equal authority to add or remove users.
    - A consensus mechanism ensures consistency by resolving concurrent changes
    within the same epoch and preventing possible conflicts.
    In each epoch, all modifications are managed exclusively by a single Steward.

Note: We chose the term Steward to reflect the role of transparently coordinating and organizing passengers at stations, much like Stewards do in transit systems. 

In multi-Steward settings, de-MLS requires a consensus among Stewards
that have equal rights in the group since changes in an epoch in MLS are required
to be conducted by a single identity, that is the Steward.

For the consensus integration, ongoing research explores two promising approaches:

1. **On-chain consensus mechanisms**:
Outsourcing consensus to a smart contract solution for transparent and immutable agreement.
2. **Off-chain consensus mechanisms**:
Utilizing off-chain consensus protocols to design efficient, decentralized protocols.

### Waku Integration

Waku integration is a crucial step in the construction of de-MLS,
aiming to replace traditional client-server communication with decentralized messaging.
The main challenge in this transition is transforming the centralized Delivery Service (DS)
into a decentralized equivalent, which performs two essential functions:

1. Message Delivery and Ordering:
The DS is responsible not only for delivering messages to the correct recipients,
but also for preserving the correct order of these messages, which is critical for the consistency of group state.
2. Key Package Management: 
The DS manages key packages, which are essential for adding members securely to a group.

To maintain a truly decentralized architecture,
key packages cannot be stored in a centralized location.
Initially, we considered using a smart contract (SC) as a decentralized substitute for server-side key package storage.
However, this approach proved impractical.
Blockchains are immutable by designâ€”once data is written, it cannot be fully removed.
This contradicts a core requirement of MLS: each key package must be used exactly once and then deleted,
to prevent replay or reuse attacks.
Instead, our solution is to require users to actively provide their key packages upon request,
allowing validation at the moment of use without persistent storage.
This ensures both compliance with MLS's security model and alignment with decentralized system principles.

### Flow

The flow section explains the processes that 
when a user wants to join a group in both Steward and users side also their interactions.
The flow of de-MLS is as follows:

![Figure 1](/img/de-mls/flow.png)

### 1. Steward joins the welcome topic

The welcome topic is a topic created and monitored by the Steward for a specific secure messaging group,
allowing any Waku node to subscribe permissionlessly.
Being in the welcome topic does not imply group membership,
it acts as a waiting room where users can send their key material,
which the Steward listens for and processes before granting access to the secure group.

### 2. Group initialization

Steward initalizes a group with parameters such as cipher suite and group ID.

### 3. Emitting Group Anouncement (GA) by Steward

Steward creates group announcement (GA) periodically to the welcome channel
that the users can find the who the Steward is.
This will be important for the next step.

### 4. User joins the welcome topic

As first, the users who wants to be part of the decentralized MLS should subscribe the welcome channel.
Then user can find the group name and also corresponding GA message from Steward.
This GA message helps the user to create a valid `keyPackages` which define in section 10 
in [RFC9420](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc9420/) for the group.

### 5. User creates its key package

User creates the `keyPackage` and encrypt by public key of the Steward then send it to the Steward.
Since the message is encrypted, stay secure though the welcome (permissionless) topic.

### 6. Steward receives the User's key package

Steward receives the user's `keyPackage` and decrypt it.
After decrypted, Steward also verifies the validity of the `keyPackage` by signature verification.
If the `keyPackage` is not valid, the Steward just drops the message,
otherwise it moves to the next step which is proposal creation.

### 7. Steward creates proposal

Proposals are special messages that may come from any participant including Steward.
In this case, Steward creates proposal corresponding user's `keyPackage`.
In regular MLS, proposals are automatically converted to the commit messages
which has the ability the change the structure of the tree but in de-MLS,
since it is decentralized, proposals should be voted before converted into the commitment.

### 8. Voting for proposal

Voting applies decentrazliation by protecting small groups can control.
Therefore, proposals must be voted before committing.
The consensus mechanism should be a lightweight consensus that cannot be bottleneck for treeKEM scalability.
Basically, the consensus returns the binary result for given a proposal.
If the result is NO, the proposal is dropped otherwise process.

Ones Steward creates the proposal send it to network for the voting.
If the result of the consensus is YES, lastly Steward sends two different message.

### 9. Creating commit message

Commit messages are the messages that starts new epochs.
They include key and tree material that existing members can generate the new state of tree.

After Steward gets the YES from consensus, Steward creates commit messages 
that inject new entropy for the existing group members.

### 10. Sending messages

After Steward creates then sends two messages:

1. Commit message informs existing group member to update their key
to align with the new memberâ€™s key for the upcoming epoch.
2. The welcome message informs the newly joined user to generate a group key
that matches the key existing members will use in the upcoming epoch.

Although existing users had different group keys in the previous epoch and the new user had none,
the Steward message ensures that both existing and new users converge on the same group key in the next epoch.

### 11. Applying welcome message

User can generate the next epoch group key by using welcome message as well as
existing users extract the same `groupKey` by using commit mesages.

The commit message helps existing members generate the next group key `Gk+1`,
while the welcome message helps the newly joining user generate the same `Gk+1`.
This provides two important security properties:

1. Forward Secrecy (FS):
The new user cannot read previous messages since they were encrypted with the old key `Gk`

2. Post-Compromise Security (PCS):
If a user is removed from the group,
they cannot read future messages since those messages will be encrypted with the new key `Gk+1`

## Benchmark

This section presents the performance evaluation of de-MLS.
One of the key advantages of the MLS protocol is its efficiency,
as it eliminates the need for pairwise message exchanges between all participants.
Instead, the decentralized DS enables the addition of new participants by sending only two messages to the group:
a commit message and a welcome message.
However, despite this advantage, the protocol does have certain bottlenecks, which are as follows:

- Firstly, the Steward must receive the key packages from each member wishing to join the group.
This process requires sequential message exchanges and involves computationally intensive tasks such as encryption,
decryption, and digital signature verification.
Even when multiple users are added to the group simultaneously, the process is essentially sequential.
The tree structure is updated one user at a time,
followed by sending the final commit message to the existing group members
and a single welcome message to the new members.
- Secondly adding a member to a group requires rebuilding the tree and computing new keys.

The following measurements were made as follows:

1. The time required for the entire sequence of receiving a user key package is presented here.
This includes generating the Steward key, creating messages with signatures and encryption,
and processing these messages.

`Share Key Package - 1.8395 ms`

Note that these measurements do not account for the time taken to forward messages.

1. The time required for creating the commit and welcome message
from a ready-made package bunches is shown in this table.

| Group Size (by users) | Time |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | 1.8662 ms |
| 100 | 14.124 ms |
| 500 | 121.85 ms |
| 1000 | 412.39 ms |
| 5000 | ~ 15-20 s |
| 10000 | ~ 1-1.5 min |

The tests were conducted on the following configuration:
Apple M3 Pro @ 4.05GHz and 12-Core CPU/18-Core GPU.

Here, the network latency and the time taken by users to apply the received commits are also excluded.
These aspects are planned to be measured and evaluated in future work.

## Potential drawbacks and countermeasures

Since de-MLS replace the servers by P2P, we could lose some good features of servers based MLS.
In this section we present the potential drawbacks and possible countermeasures of de-MLS.

- Offline users: `keyPackage`s are provided by the users directly without any storing,
this is required each user must be online for joining to a group.
    - We can consider to use [Waku sync nodes](https://docs.waku.org/guides/js-waku/store-retrieve-messages/)
    that are nodes has storing ability for a temporary storing of `keyPackage`s.
- DoS attack to Steward: Steward is known in welcome message from periodic group announcement message
so Steward can be targeted for DoS attack.
    - As always we consider to use Rate-Limiting Nullifier (RLN) with Waku to protect network from spam.
- Message loss or delay : Because of P2P and consensus settings, message can be lost or delayed.,
    - We can integrate reliability mechanisms to Waku such as
    [scalable data sync (SDS)](https://github.com/waku-org/nim-sds)
    - Consensus mechanism requires to provide liveness property against offline nodes, for example,
    it may provides default YES or NO options for a silent users who do not vote.
- Enchanced authentication
    - Ethereum authentication could be inefficient.
    We can configure the authentication mechanism for example asking minimum balance or etc.

## Conclusion

To summarize, the approach to solving decentralized DS tasks with Waku
can be outlined as shown in the comparison table:

| Feature | MLS | de-MLS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Message Distribution | Messages are sent from the server to clients | Messages are sent by publishing/subscribing to pub-sub topics |
| Commit Message Handling | Relies on a server | Relies on a consensus and transparent Steward |
| Key Package Management | Key packages are stored and distributed by the server | Key packages are provided by the users themselves |

## Future Work

In the next iterations, the implementations are planned as following:

- Dual-Consensus Multi-Steward Support: One consensus mechanism selects an Steward from all users,
while a second governs group decisions among the elected Stewards
- Consensus mechanism for handling concurrent changes within the same epoch
- Key rotation
- Benchmarking for the multi-Steward configuration including the network time
