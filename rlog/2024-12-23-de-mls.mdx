## Introduction

Secure Group Messaging (SGM) is resource-intensive when aiming for robust security features like forward secrecy (FS) and post-compromise security (PCS). 

One straightforward approach to SGM is a pairwise group chat, where each pair of group members establishes a unique encryption key using Diffie-Hellman. While this method ensures security, it falls short in terms of practicality:

- **High storage requirements**: Each participant must store encryption keys for every other participant.
- **Inefficient encryption**: Each message must be encrypted separately for every participant, leading to significant computational overhead.
- **Cumbersome group management**: Adding or removing users and refreshing keys becomes increasingly inefficient as the group grows.

One scalable solution for SGM is Message Layer Security (MLS). Leveraging TreeKEM, MLS organizes group members in a cryptographic tree structure, where each participant is responsible for maintaining specific parts of the tree.

In this post, we present the implementation details of the first version of Decentralized MLS (de-MLS) which is an SGM protocol that satisfies the following features:

- Decentralized
- Scalable
- End-to-end encrypted (E2EE) 
- FS and PCS provided
- Ethereum authenticated 

## Background

### MLS

The Message Layer Security (MLS) protocol offers scalable and secure group messaging protocol by organizing participants into a cryptographic tree structure, enabling efficient operations like adding or removing members with logarithmic time complexity relative to the group size. MLS provides strong security guarantees, including FS and PCS. 

MLS assumes that we have the two services are provided:

   *  An Authentication Service (AS): It enables group members to
      authenticate the credentials presented by other group members.

   *  A Delivery Service (DS) that routes MLS messages among the
      participants in the protocol in the correct order and manage the keyPackage of the users where the keyPackage is the object in MLS that each user can securely generate the latest state of keys in the group.  
      
Despite its scalability, MLS has a notable limitation: it is inherently designed for server-based federated architectures for delivery service (DS), even when the servers themselves don't need to be trusted. To achieve a decentralized protocol, the functionality of DS must be reimagined to eliminate reliance on a central server while preserving the protocol's security properties. Thus, we proposed decentralized MLS (de-MLS), leveraging Waku nodes as peer-to-peer communication protocols to eliminate reliance on centralized servers.

Lastly, MLS operates on an epoch-based model, where group state changes (e.g., adding/removing users or key refreshes) occur between epochs that are always required to be conducted by a single entity. For example, if a user is removed in epoch `E`, the rest of the group members generate a new key in epoch `E + 1` by passing the new entropy. The removed user cannot decrypt messages sent after epoch `E + 1`.

### Waku

Waku is a peer-to-peer communication network designed to facilitate private, secure, and censorship-resistant communication by eliminating centralized intermediaries. Built on the Gossipsub protocol, Waku operates as a messaging layer where users join groups by subscribing to specific pub-sub topics. These topics define the scope and nature of the messages exchanged, allowing for adaptable communication patterns. The Waku network is composed of multiple interconnected Waku nodes.

## de-MLS 

Decentralized MLS (de-MLS) is a peer-to-peer SGM protocol compatible with any P2P messaging application for the DS, with Waku selected as the messaging protocol. Decentralization is achieved not only at the DS level but also within the authentication service (AS). Multiple special nodes in the group serve as authorized identities to authenticate users before they join or are removed from the group.

de-MLS provides two different user management configurations, both utilizing the Waku protocol for DS:

1. **Single Admin Over a Single Waku Node**: 
   - A single authorized identity (admin) manages the group including removing or adding users.
   
2. **Multi-Admin Over Multiple Waku Nodes**: 
   - Multiple admins have equal authority to add or remove users.
    - A consensus mechanism ensures consistency by resolving concurrent changes within the same epoch and preventing possible conflicts. In each epoch, all modifications are managed exclusively by a single admin.

In multi-admin settings, de-MLS requires a consensus among admins that have equal rights in the group since changes in an epoch in MLS are required to be conducted by a single identity, that is the admin. 

For the consensus integration, ongoing research explores two promising approaches:

1. **On-chain consensus mechanisms**: Outsourcing consensus to a smart contract solution for transparent and immutable agreement.
2. **Off-chain consensus mechanisms**: Utilizing off-chain consensus protocol to design efficient, decentralized protocols.

### Waku Integration

Waku integration is one of step of building the de-MLS by replacing the client-server messages with the Waku communication. The main challenge in moving to a decentralized system was converting the centralized DS to the decentralized DS; which has two key functions.

1. Sending out messages, which includes not only sending to the correct user but also deciding on the correct sequence (docs reference here). 
2. Manages the key package of users. 

To ensure decentralization, key packages cannot be stored in a centralized location. Initially, the idea of using a smart contract (SC) as a replacement for the server-side, from the package manager's perspective, was considered. However, this approach proved unsuitable because, once data is added to the blockchain, it cannot be deleted without leaving a trace. One of the key requirements is that each package must be used only once and then deleted afterward, which conflicts with the immutable nature of blockchain storage. Instead, users must provide them upon request to be validated.

### Distribution of the Messages

Since the Waku is based on gossipsub protocol and accordingly from the network point of view joining a group for a user will look like subscribing to the necessary topics.

We have pub-sub topics that send messages in the network. We also have content topics, which determine the groups and what messages are sent.

There are three types of topics: 
- `app_msg`: The owner of the topic where messages encrypted with the group key are sent, thanks to encryption, even if someone not from the group subscribes to the topic, they will not be able to read the correspondence itself.
- `commit_msg`: All messages related to changes in the group state - adding users, deleting users, key rotation - are sent here. By design only administrators can send messages about the deletion and addition of users, key update is still under development. At this stage proposal and commit messages are not differentiated and all are considered commit messages
-  `welcome`: A special topic for joining the group. With it, we solve the problem of how users can join a group without the server side. This topic is also used for providing the key packages by the users. 

This architecture does not require a direct 1-to-1 channel with the admin for join requests. However, it does allow for the possibility that the admin can personally request a key package and manually add a member to the group.

### Managing the Key Packages

As previously mentioned, the core concept is that users provide their key packages themselves through the welcome topic when joining a group. The working process of the welcome topic is as follows: 

- When a group is created, the admin (or admins) periodically publish a special public key along with a signature at a set frequency (e.g., once per epoch). New users initially subscribe only to this content topic, and upon receiving the message, they encrypt their key package using the provided public key.
- At the end of the epoch, the administrator prepares a commit message containing the details of all new users (if they are approved to join the group). This commit message is published in the commit channel, followed by a welcome message sent to all new users in the current channel.
- If the previous process is completed successfully, all new users are subscribed to the relevant topics and receive the group key, which enables encrypted messaging for all members of the group. 
- Admin deletes the key packages with the next epoch.
- If a user fails to send a valid message to the current epoch, his message is rejected and he has to get the key again and repeat the whole procedure.

The current implementation assumes support for a single admin. This is because achieving consensus among multiple users would require agreement on which commits to accept, which to reject, and in what order they should be processed. 

## Architecture notes

The architectural design of the de-MLS implementation can be analyzed through two key aspects: the actor-based model and the use of cryptographic keys.

**Actor-based model:** 

The architecture is built on an actor-based model, enabling a focus on the processing of messages rather than the specifics of how messages are transmitted between different entities. The following actors are implemented as described below:

- `waku actor` manages the generation and transmission of messages to Waku, including subscribing to and unsubscribing from topics. Message reception from Waku is designed as a continuous stream of events from the node, which are processed and routed to other actors for further handling.
- `user actor` manages user-related functionalities, such as user creation, group management, and message handling.
- `group actor` handles group-related operations, including group creation, membership management, and message broadcasting.

**Cryptographic keys:**

- `Ethereum key` is used to authenticate the user via their private key, with the user's ID essentially functioning as their wallet address. Alternatively, this step can be replaced by any Web3 service that supports authorization. Therefore, all users in the group can be assured about the authenticity of the other users.
- `OpenMLS keys` is utilized for the reference implementation of de-MLS based on OpenMLS, which provides all necessary APIs to work with MLS such as creating and storing key packages. The ultimate goal is to leverage Ethereum accounts to manage all necessary keys for groups. However, since OpenMLS currently lacks support for Ethereum curve operations, these keys are temporarily linked through specification within the identity wallet rather than direct allocation.
- `Admin keys` is a constantly rotating key used in the welcome topic to securely receive key packages from users.

## Benchmark

This section presents the performance evaluation of de-MLS. One of the key advantages of the MLS protocol is its efficiency, as it eliminates the need for pairwise message exchanges between all participants. Instead, the decentralized DS enables the addition of new participants by sending only two messages to the group: a commit message and a welcome message. However, despite this advantage, the protocol does have certain bottlenecks, which are as follows: 

- Firstly, the admin must receive the key packages from each member wishing to join the group. This process requires sequential message exchanges and involves computationally intensive tasks such as encryption, decryption, and digital signature verification. Even when multiple users are added to the group simultaneously, the process is essentially sequential. The tree structure is updated one user at a time, followed by sending the final commit message to the existing group members and a single welcome message to the new members.
- Secondly adding a member to a group requires rebuilding the tree and computing new keys.  

The following measurements were made as follows:

1. The time required for the entire sequence of receiving a user key package is presented here. This includes generating the admin key, creating messages with signatures and encryption, and processing these messages.

`Share Key Package - 1.8395 ms`

Note that these measurements do not account for the time taken to forward messages.

2. The time required for creating the commit and welcome message from a ready-made package bunches is shown in this table.

| Group Size (by users) | Time           |
|------------|----------------|
| 10    | 1.8662 ms      |
| 100   | 14.124 ms      |
| 500   | 121.85 ms      |
| 1000  | 412.39 ms      |
| 5000  | ~ 15-20 s      |
| 10000 | ~ 1-1.5 min    |

The tests were conducted on the following configuration:
Apple M3 Pro @ 4.05GHz and 12-Core CPU/18-Core GPU. 

Here, the network latency and the time taken by users to apply the received commits are also excluded. These aspects are planned to be measured and evaluated in future work. 

## Conclusion

To summarize, the approach to solving decentralized DS tasks with Waku can be outlined as shown in the comparison table:

| Feature| MLS | de-MLS |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Message Distribution | Messages are sent from the server to clients | Messages are sent by publishing/subscribing to pub-sub topics |
| Commit Message Handling | Relies on a server | Relies on a admin  |
| Key Package Management | Key packages are stored and distributed by the server | Key packages are provided by the users themselves |

## Future Work

In the next iterations, the implementations are planned as following:

- Multi-admin support over multiple Waku nodes
- Consensus mechanism for handling concurrent changes within the same epoch
- On-chain and off-chain consensus mechanisms
- Key rotation
- Benchmarking for the multi-admin configuration including the network time
