# Introduction

The blockchain space is rapidly evolving, and with it, new technologies are emerging that promise enhanced privacy, scalability, and security. 
As decentralized systems grow in complexity and usage, the need for secure and private computation has never been greater.
Zero-knowledge virtual machines (zkVMs) are one such innovation, allowing for computations to be proven correct without revealing the underlying data. 
ZkVMs have enormous implications for privacy-preserving applications, decentralized finance (DeFi), and other blockchain-based use cases.
However,  as the term "zkVM" becomes more widely adopted, it is critical to distinguish between projects that truly satisfy the stringent requirements of a zkVM and those that do not.


# What is a zkVM?
A zkVM is a virtual machine that combines the principles of cryptographic proof generation and privacy preservation with the computational model 
of traditional virtual machines. Essentially, a zkVM enables the execution of arbitrary programs while generating cryptographic proofs—specifically, zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)—that 
can verify the correctness of these computations without revealing any sensitive information. This ensures that computations can be trusted while protecting the privacy of the data involved. 
The key characteristics of a zkVM include:

- Proof generation: The ability to produce ZKPs that verify the correct execution of programs. There are several types of cryptographic techniques used in zkVMs to 
generate these proofs, such as zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, and recursive proofs. A zkVM’s ability to generate these proofs determines how effectively it can ensure the integrity of computations 
in a privacy-preserving manner.
- Privacy preservation: The system must maintain privacy, ensuring that only the proof is revealed, not the underlying computation or data. Privacy-preserving zkVMs allow users to maintain 
confidentiality without compromising the security or verifiability of their operations. However, not all zkVMs achieve the same level of privacy. Some may focus more on proof generation 
and scalability while deprioritizing privacy features, which can limit their use in certain privacy-sensitive applications.
- Scalability and performance: zkVMs should offer scalable and efficient computation, leveraging advanced cryptographic techniques like zk-SNARKs, zk-STARKs, or recursive proofs. 
A zkVM's performance must also be measured in terms of latency (time to generate and verify a proof) and throughput (number of computations processed within a certain time frame).
- Verifiable computation: The zkVM should be able to prove the execution of arbitrary programs in a secure and verifiable manner. Verifiable computation ensures that zkVMs can be deployed 
across a wide range of applications, from DeFi to private data-sharing platforms and more.

# Why zkVMs matter

The rise of zkVMs is a crucial development for the future of blockchain and decentralized technologies. As more systems require the ability to scale while maintaining privacy and trust, 
zkVMs provide a powerful solution. They offer the potential to reshape the way decentralized applications (dapps) handle sensitive information, enabling them to be both efficient and private.

It is essential to distinguish between projects that fully realize the potential of zkVMs and those that do not. In the remainder of this post, we evaluate several zkVM projects, analyzing 
whether they satisfy the criteria for being classified as zkVMs based on our research.

# Our methodology

We analyzed each project’s documentation, source code, and available benchmarks to determine whether they meet the definition of a zkVM. 
Our criteria focus on the key capabilities of zkVMs—proof generation, privacy, scalability, and integration with existing systems.

# Insights and conclusions

Our analysis reveals that many of the projects labeled as zkVMs do meet the core criteria for zkVMs, offering verifiable computation and proof generation 
as foundational features. However, a number of these projects fall short of delivering full zero-knowledge privacy. Projects like Risc0, Aleo, and Miden stand out as leading zkVM frameworks 
that balance proof generation, privacy, and scalability, offering strong platforms for developers seeking to build privacy-preserving applications.

Conversely, projects like SP1 and Nexus excel in generating verifiable proofs but currently lack comprehensive zero-knowledge privacy mechanisms. These platforms are excellent for 
scenarios where proof generation and scalability are paramount, but privacy is not a primary concern.

As zkVM technology continues to evolve, we expect to see more projects integrating enhanced privacy-preserving mechanisms while simultaneously improving performance and scalability. 
This ongoing development will likely broaden the application of zkVMs across the blockchain ecosystem, particularly in privacy-sensitive sectors such as finance, data security, 
and decentralized applications.
