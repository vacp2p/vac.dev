# Vac 2024 Year in Review
With 2024 now behind us and a new year ahead, 
Vac is proud to reflect on the milestones and breakthroughs that defined another year of researching and developing free and open digital public goods for the [Institute of Free Technology](https://free.technology/) and wider web3 ecosystem.

Vac comprises various subteams and service units, each with its own focus. 
Below, we celebrate each unit's achievements and look forward to its 2025 plans.

## Nescience
Nescience is our state separation architecture that aims to enable private transactions and provide a general-purpose execution environment for classical applications. 

### Highlights
This year, the Nescience state separation architecture moved from exploration to real progress, 
taking significant steps towards building a functional and reliable system. 
The team focused on turning ideas into something real, 
testing the proposed architecture, 
and understanding its strengths and weaknesses.

* ZkVM exploration and benchmarks  
  * Published [deep reviews of 23 existing zkVMs](https://vac.dev/rlog/zkVM-explorations/)  
  * [Benchmarked the performance of the six zkVMs](https://vac.dev/rlog/zkVM-testing/) that best fit Nescience  
* Defined the NSSA architecture  
  * Brought clarity to NSSA’s design and explained the system’s architecture [in a lengthy exploratory blog post](https://vac.dev/rlog/Nescience-state-separation-architecture/)   
* Built the sandboxed testnet  
  * Designed the first version of the node specification  
  * All core components (execution types, UTXOs, cryptographic primitives) implemented and being tested  
  * Testing the performance of all execution types in various scenarios 

We also made progress on the essential parts of NSSA’s system, including:

* Key protocol for secure key management  
* Execution types and circuits for reliable computation  
* UTXO specification to manage state transitions effectively  
* Cryptography module to ensure privacy and security

### Looking forward
In 2025, the Nescience team plans to double down on what works, fix what doesn’t, and push NSSA closer to real-world use.

* Sandboxed testnet data analysis – the sandboxed testnet will be our primary data source that we will analyse to identify issues, limitations, and areas for improvement.   
* Expanding the node – expand sandboxed components into a full node implementation with rigorous testing and iterative optimization (to bridge the gap between proof of concept and production readiness).   
* Finalizing the architecture and RFC – after completing NSSA’s architecture, we will draft an RFC to ensure transparency and enable greater collaboration with the broader ecosystem.   
* Testing real-life scenarios – applying NSSA to diverse, practical use cases to assess its adaptability, performance, and impact.   
* Ongoing optimization – ensure NSSA is robust, efficient, and ready to scale.

## Heading into 2025
This year has seen Vac involved with many research, development, and testing undertakings in support of IFT portfolio projects. 
The digital public goods that emerge from our efforts not only support the organization itself but are open and free to use by any project that would benefit. 

As we move into 2025, we aim to nurture a stronger RFC culture across the IFT to encourage greater collaboration and knowledge sharing among portfolio projects. 
Our goal is to serve as an internal conduit of expertise within the organization, supported by a strong RFC culture, maintaining a repository of internal knowledge creation, and identifying and facilitating IFT project synergies. 
Such an approach should lead to greater efficiencies across the organization. 

We also aim to establish a diverse research community around Vac, and our efforts in this regard are already underway. 
In the final quarter of 2024, Vac stepped up its collaboration with the libp2p community and made a concerted effort to engage the community on the [Vac forum](https://forum.vac.dev/). 
In 2025, we aim to continue working closely with those communities to which we already have ties, such as the libp2p, Ethereum, and Nim ecosystems. 

We look forward to continuing our journey with you\!
