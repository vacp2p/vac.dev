Also, the financial punishment of spammers is cryptographically guaranteed.\nIn this solution, privacy is guaranteed since: 1) Peers do not have to disclose any piece of personally identifiable information in any phase i.e., neither in the registration nor in the messaging phase 2) Peers can prove that they have not exceeded the messaging rate in a zero-knowledge manner and without leaving any trace to their membership accounts.\nFurthermore, all the computations are light hence this solution fits the heterogenous p2p messaging system.
