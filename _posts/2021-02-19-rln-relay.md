## Introduction

This blog is going to give you an overview of how we enabled spam protection in waku relay through rate-limiting nullifiers or rln for short.

What does spamming stand for? well, in a messaging protocol (or any other system) spammers are the entities of the system who may maliciously / purposefully inject a large number of messages to the network hence spam the system (not nice, right!). The intention for such behavior depends on the use-case, but what matters is that spam messages congest the system, and affect the availability where users get busy by spending their computational power/bandwidth/storage capacity on processing spam messages. 

So, regardless of whether spammers have a good or bad intention, we put a general rule to save everyone's life and that is **no one can publish more than 1 messages per epoch** (is it too restrictive!? one per epoch!?) don't worry, we set the epoch to a reasonable value so that it does not slow down the communication of innocent users but will make the life of spammers harder!
<!-- TODO may give a value for the epoch--> 

The story is all about how to enforce this limit on each user's messaging rate. This brings us to the Rate Limiting Nullifiers and how we integrate this technique into Waku v2 (in specific the `WakuRelay` protocol) to protect our valuable users against spammers.

## Overview
The idea is as follows:


Firstly let me give a little background about Waku. Waku has a peer-to-peer (p2p) structure, that is, it relies on no central server and messages get transmitted in the network by users' collaboration. The underlying protocol (as the writeup of this blog) is GossipSub. In a very informal way, it is like I send a message to you, you send it to whoever you know, and it goes on till the message reaches its destination.  

To enable protection against spammers, we consider all the users in the network as a large group (later we can split them into smaller groups, but for now consider only one). Thus, users have to register to that group to be able to send messages. A user registers to the group by setting public and private keys (think of it as the username and password). The private key remains at the user side but the public key becomes a part of the group information (publicly available) and everyone has access to it. Public keys are not human-generated (like usernames) and instead they are random numbers, as such, they do not reveal any information about the owner (think of them as pseudonyms). 

Registration is mandatory for the users who want to publish a message, however, users who only want to listen to the messages are more than welcome and do not have to register to the group. 

By now, you may think of who creates the group and manages it? that is a great question and we will discuss it in the subsequent sections.

Once a user registers to the group, she can start sending messages conditioned to the rate limit i.e, one message per epoch. To enforce that, each publishing user has to attach **some information** about her public key into the message. As such, if a user attempts to publish more than one message per epoch, all the other users will catch it by looking at the public key information in the published messages.
