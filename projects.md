# Projects

There are several projects under Vac Research.
These are largely independent and can be seen as specific bets.

## Secure Messaging

We design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.

## zk-WASM

Research into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.

## RAD - RFCs & Dissemination

**RFCs**: We build [specifications](https://rfc.vac.dev) for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. [Rough consensus and running code](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/).

**Dissemination**: We write papers and collaborate closely with other projects/institutions, and aim to build a bridge between industry and academia.

## Applied ZK & Explorations

We build tools to enable new fundamental building blocks using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems. For example, [Zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/).
