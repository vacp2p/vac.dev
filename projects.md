# Vac projects

There are several projects under Vac.
These are largely independent and can be seen as specific bets.

## Secure Messaging

We design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.

## zk-WASM

Research into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.

## RFC

We build specifications for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. Rough consensus and running code.

## Applied ZK/Explorations

We build tools to enable privacy-enhanced computations using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems.
