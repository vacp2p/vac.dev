# Vac - Communication, Privacy, Etc.

## About Vac

Vac **builds** [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) protocols for the decentralized web.

We do applied research based on which we build protocols, libraries and publications. Custodians of protocols that reflect [a set of principles](vac.dev/principles) - liberty, privacy, etc.

## Our Principles

Liberty, censorship resistance, security, privacy, transparency, openness, decentralization, inclusivity, continuance, resourcefulness.

These principles act as tools. Tools for thinking, for communication, and for decentralized decision making. They keep us honest about where we are failing short of our vision.

The full list can be found here: [Vac Principles](vac.dev/principles).

## Projects

**Secure Messaging**. We design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.

**zk-WASM**. Research into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.

**RAD - RFCs & Dissemination**. We build specifications for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. Rough consensus and running code. We also write papers and aim collaborate closely with other institutions to build a bridge between industry and academia.

**Applied ZK & Explorations**. We build tools to enable new fundamental building blocks using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems.
