## Vac - Communication, Privacy, Etc.

### About Vac

Vac **builds** [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) protocols for the decentralized web.

We do applied research based on which we build protocols, libraries and publications. Custodians of protocols that reflect [a set of principles](vac.dev/principles) - liberty, privacy, etc.

### Our Principles

Liberty, censorship resistance, security, privacy, transparency, openness, decentralization, inclusivity, continuance, resourcefulness.

Full list can be found here: [Vac Principles](vac.dev/principles).

### Projects

**Secure Messaging**. We design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.

**zk-WASM**. Research into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.

**RFCs**. We build specifications for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. Rough consensus and running code.

**Applied ZK/Explorations**. We build tools to enable privacy-enhanced computations using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems.
