## Research Areas

We are seeking to collaborate with academia in the following topic areas.
If you are interested and bring your own funding or want to contribute as a side project, feel free to reach out.

### DHT (distributed hash table) security / privacy / anonymity

Compared to unstructured P2P overlay networks, DHTs offer efficient and (theoretically) reliable discovery.
However, they are prone to eclipse attacks and typically offer weak privacy properties.
This topic comprises researching novel techniques mitigating or even thwarting eclipse attacks against DHTs.
A focus on [discv5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) would be of special interest to the Vac team.

### privacy/anonymity analysis of various Waku/libp2p protocols

This topic is modular. Parts can be addressed as internships and Master theses.
A combination, including researching countermeasures, could be addressed within the framework of a PhD thesis.
