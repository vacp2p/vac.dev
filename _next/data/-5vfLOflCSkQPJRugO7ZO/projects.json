{"pageProps":{"markdown":{"content":"\n# Projects\n\nThere are several projects under Vac Research.\nThese are largely independent and can be seen as specific bets.\n\n## Secure Messaging\n\nWe design modular, p2p protocols for private, anonymous, secure and censorship-resistant communications. The main focus is [Waku](https://waku.org), the communication layer for Web3.\n\n## zk-WASM\n\nResearch into making private and provable computation using WASM that is verified using zero-knowledge proofs.\n\n## RAD - RFCs & Dissemination\n\n**RFCs**: We build [specifications](https://rfc.vac.dev) for self-sustainable robust protocols with strong and modular privacy guarantees. [Rough consensus and running code](https://www.ietf.org/about/participate/tao/).\n\n**Dissemination**: We write papers and collaborate closely with other projects/institutions, and aim to build a bridge between industry and academia.\n\n## Applied ZK & Explorations\n\nWe build tools to enable new fundamental building blocks using cutting-edge zero-knowledge proof systems. For example, [Zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/).\n\n\n","metadata":{"title":"Projects"},"toc":[{"content":"Projects","slug":"projects","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"Secure Messaging","slug":"secure-messaging","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"zk-WASM","slug":"zk-wasm","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"RAD - RFCs & Dissemination","slug":"rad-rf-cs-dissemination","lvl":2,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Applied ZK & Explorations","slug":"applied-zk-explorations","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Projects"},"navOrder":1678965411.479,"localPath":"projects.md","path":["projects"],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{"path":["projects"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
