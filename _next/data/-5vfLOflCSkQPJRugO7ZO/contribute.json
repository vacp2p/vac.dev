{"pageProps":{"markdown":{"content":"# Contribute\n\n## How to Contribute\n\nGet in touch with us by\n[joining our Discord](https://discord.gg/PQFdubGt6d),\n[opening a thread in our forum](https://forum.vac.dev/),\nor [opening issues / PRs on GitHub](https://github.com/vacp2p).\n\nAlso, see our [Current Job Openings](https://jobs.status.im/?search=Vac),\nand the [Waku contribute page](https://waku.org/contribute).\n\n## What to Contribute\n\nWe are interested in both research and code contributions.\n\nFor research contributions,\nsee our [open research problems page](https://vac.dev/open-problems),\nor browse our [research areas](https://vac.dev/research-areas).\n\nFor code contributions, see our \"good first issue\" lists for various Vac related code bases:\n\n* [nwaku](https://github.com/status-im/nwaku/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n* [js-waku](https://github.com/status-im/js-waku/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n* [go-waku](https://github.com/status-im/go-waku/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n* [zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit/labels/good%20first%20issue)\n\n# Contribute Pseudonymously\n\nWe welcome everyone to contribute to our projects by submitting an issue or a pull request to any of the repository hosted in our [Vac](https://github.com/vacp2p) GitHub page.\n\n**We consider and encourage anonymous contributions!**\n\nFor this reason, we collect some advice on how to contribute pseudonymously to Vac.\n\n## Setting-up a new Github account\n\nHaving a GitHub account will enormously simplify your contribution process,\nsince you will be able to open issues and PRs directly in the repository of your interest and interact with other contributors. \n\nWe acknowledge that this implies that GitHub, in order to provide you its services,\nneeds to process some (potentially sensitive) information about you, like your IP address, e-mail address, browser configuration, cookies, and so on\n(for a complete list see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#what-information-github-collects)).\n\nTo mitigate leakage of such potentially sensitive information, you might:\n\n- use a [VPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_network) or [TOR](https://www.torproject.org/);\n- register a new dedicated e-mail address with a privacy-focused provider (e.g., [Proton](https://proton.me))\n- register a new GitHub account with such dedicated e-mail address;\n- eventually setup 2FA using hardware keys or an open source authenticator app that does not collect personal information\n  (e.g., [andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP) for Android and [Tofu](https://github.com/calleluks/Tofu) for iOS);\n- generate a new and dedicated public key to sign commits with the newly created account;\n\nBe aware of [device fingerprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_fingerprint)!\nTo mitigate this, you could:\n\n- use a dedicated browser which minimizes fingerprint leakages (e.g., TOR browser);\n- navigate from a dedicated live or virtual machine running an\n  [open-source and privacy-oriented operating system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-focused_operating_system) (e.g., by using the [QEMU](https://github.com/qemu/qemu)/[KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org) stack) \n\n## Contribute by e-mail\n\nIf you are not interested in setting up a dedicated GitHub account or you plan to contribute occasionally,\nyou can send us your commits in the form of [*mail patches*](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-format-patch).\n\nAfter cloning the repository of your interest, remember to run\n\n```\ngit config user.name \"Anonymous\"\ngit config user.email anonymous@example.com\n```\n\nto override the username and mail address used in local commits to the repository.\n\nIf you plan to contribute to a specific branch `<branch>`,\nwe suggest you to create and locally work on a new branch `<new_branch>` based on it, i.e. \n\n```\ngit checkout <branch>\ngit branch <new_branch>\ngit checkout <new_branch>\n```\n\nOnce your local contribution is ready to be published, run\n\n```\ngit format-patch <branch> -o <folder>\n```\n\nto store in `<folder>` all patch files corresponding to your commits that will update `<branch>` to the latest state of `<new_branch>`.\n\nOnce done, send us an email to **`contribute@vac.dev`** providing as\n- object: the repository name you have worked on and the commit hash at the time of your local branch creation; \n- body message: a short description of your contribution; \n- attachments: all `.patch` files in `<folder>`.\n\nNote that we automatically discard e-mails containing one or more attachments which do not have a `.patch` extension.\n\nOnce received, we will review your contribution and eventually create a pull request on your behalf.\n\n#### E-Mail Encryption\n\nOur `contribute@vac.dev` e-mail address is based on [Proton](https://proton.me) services.\n\nWhen you write us from a (dedicated) Proton e-mail address, your messages and attachments will be [automatically](https://proton.me/support/how-to-use-pgp) end-to-end encrypted using PGP.\n\nIf you don't have a Proton e-mail address, you can directly encrypt the contents of your message using our PGP public key:\n\n```\n-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\nVersion: ProtonMail\n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\nGiOytfFQQCDNkGE0RAo=\n=SlIb\n-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----\n```\n\n\nThis public key can be also downloaded [here](https://mail-api.proton.me/pks/lookup?op=get&search=contribute@vac.dev),\nby using Proton's public APIs.\n\nSince a bad encryption will result in our impossibility to access your contribution,\nwe invite you to check the official documentation of your e-mail client or provider in order to correctly setup the appropriate PGP keys\nand automate message encryption and decryption.\n","metadata":{},"toc":[{"content":"Contribute","slug":"contribute","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"How to Contribute","slug":"how-to-contribute","lvl":2,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"What to Contribute","slug":"what-to-contribute","lvl":2,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Contribute Pseudonymously","slug":"contribute-pseudonymously","lvl":1,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Setting-up a new Github account","slug":"setting-up-a-new-github-account","lvl":2,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"Contribute by e-mail","slug":"contribute-by-e-mail","lvl":2,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"E-Mail Encryption","slug":"e-mail-encryption","lvl":4,"i":6,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"contribute"},"navOrder":1678965408.474,"localPath":"contribute.md","path":["contribute"],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{"path":["contribute"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
