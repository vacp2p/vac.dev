We strongly recommend getting creative and building what it means the most to you and your community.\n* P2P social network\n* E-voting system\n* P2P Email service\n* Online p2p Games\n* P2P scoring and recommendation systems\n\n### Halo2 in a browser\n\n[Halo2](https://halo2.dev) is an emerging proof system that,\nin combination with [PLONK](https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/953) and a polynomial commitment scheme [based on the Inner Product Argument](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/design/proving-system/inner-product.html), \nallows creation of short zero-knowledge proofs for arbitrary statements.\nHalo2 gained interest from the community because, \nin contrast to the well enstablished [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) proof system, \nit doesn't require a trusted setup \nand allows proof recursion, \nthat is the possibility to compute an efficiently-verifiable ZK proof that attests correctness of an arbitrary number of other ZK proofs.\n\nHowever, at the [current stage](https://github.com/zcash/halo2), Halo2 requires more research and engineering work to make it work efficiently as Groth16 in practice.\n\nThis topic focuses on researching and implementing all those possible optimiziations to PLONK/Halo2 in order to ultimately allow proof computations and verification in the browser, using WASM.\n\n### Meshnet transports and libp2p\n\nWaku protocols are built on top of [libp2p's modular network stack](https://libp2p.io/).\nThis in essence allows the Waku network to be overlayed on existing network links. \nSeveral transports are already supported:\ndepending on the specific underlying libp2p implementation,\nsupported transports could include WebSockets, QUIC, TCP, WebRTC, etc. \nHowever, currently all transports are IP-based\nand require Waku nodes to have an active Internet connection to communicate outside of the local IP network.\nNot only does this presuppose access to reliable Internet connectivity,\nbut such links are vulnerable to data profiling and censorship by ISPs or other entities.\n\nThis topic focuses on using Waku over non-IP routed networks,\nsuch as [Wireless Mesh Networks](https://www.pcworld.com/article/407165/mesh-network-explained.html)\nto improve accessibility and strengthen resistance against censorship.\nIt also investigates how appropriate the libp2p network stack is for such environments\nand if Waku could benefit from using different networking stacks\nthat may function better in very restrictive environments.\n\n### Applied ZK\n\nTo help scale and secure Waku network,\nnodes should be incentivized to join and reliably provide services to users\nlike [Relay](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/11/), [Store](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/13/), [Filter](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/12/), and so on.\n\nHowever, providing services costs network nodes computational and hardware resources.\n\nIn this topic we would like to design a protocol that, tailored to Waku, can:\n\n- incentivize Waku nodes to provide services (e.g., economically); \n- provide a high level of privacy and anonimyty for both users consuming services and nodes providing them;\n- disincentivize non protocol-compliant behaviours;\n\nWe envision a private fungible settlment among consumers and service providers \nbased on zero-knowledge proofs for high privacy guarantees \nand on-chain smart-contracts to economically incentivize protocol-compliant behaviours.\n\n### Robust P2P network - NAT traversal\n\n[Waku relay](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/11/), Waku's core protocol, is based on a [gossipsub mesh](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/pubsub/gossipsub),\nwhile [Waku discv5](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/33/) uses a [DHT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table) overlay.\nBoth significantly benefit from robust and reliable P2P connections.\nBetter connectivity allows nodes to contribute more to the network and improve overall availability, efficiency, and by extension, anonymity ([see k-anonymity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-anonymity)).\n\n[NAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation) is a well known problem to P2P connectivity.\nThere are various types of NATs whose behaviours are described in [RFC 4787](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4787).\n[Carrier-Grade NATs](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6888) add another layer of indirection, which complicates the matter further.\nVarious [NAT traversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAT_traversal) protocols have been developed to overcome the different types of NATs.\n[RFC 8445](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8445) specifies Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE), which integrates a set of NAT traversal techniques.\nWaku currently uses [libp2p NAT traversal](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/),\nspecifically [STUN](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#hole-punching-stun) (leveraging the [identify protocol](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/protocols/#identify))\nand [AutoNAT](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/#hole-punching-stun#autonat).\n\nThe main focus of this topic is on researching novel ICE-complementary NAT traversal techniques that are decentralized and have desirable privacy and anonymity properties.\nThe topic also comprises integrating and specifying ICE for [Waku v2](https://rfc.vac.dev/spec/10/).\n\n### Peer scoring in peer-to-peer networks\n\nPeer-to-peer networks are made of multiple nodes or peers, typically in the range of hundreds or even thousands. This makes it impossible to keep all nodes connected in a full-mesh network since it would involve an exponentially increasing number of connections. This means that each node has to just connect to a small subset of all nodes, which has to be chosen wisely. Some unanswered questions:\n* Which nodes do we connect to? Based on what criteria?\n* How do we keep quality peers while being forgiving with nodes with fewer resources or that are syncing?\n* Can we handle our peers in a way that prevents eclipse attacks?\n* Can we give each peer a score and select the best one based on it?\n* Which parameters should be considered in the score?\n* What kind of behavior should we consider as bad?\n* Can we integrate Waku-specific features into the score and/or the bad-behavior metric?\n\nThis not only involves an efficient peer discovery strategy, which gives us a pool of peers to select from, but also strategies to select the ones we are interested in and drop connections with the ones we are not. Protocols like GossipSub have their [score](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.1.md#the-score-function) and it's something that can be used as a baseline, but unfortunately does not take into account Waku specifics.\n\n\n# Further Research Collaboration Opportunities\n\nBesides the open research problems listed in the section above,\nyou may browse our [Research Areas](https://vac.dev/research-areas) page\nand check our roadmaps for various research topics.\n\n\n","metadata":{"title":"Open Research Problems"},"toc":[{"content":"Open Research Problems","slug":"open-research-problems","lvl":1,"i":0,"seen":0},{"content":"DHT (distributed hash table) security / privacy / anonymity","slug":"dht-distributed-hash-table-security-privacy-anonymity","lvl":3,"i":1,"seen":0},{"content":"Privacy-Preserving Incentivizations of waku protocols","slug":"privacy-preserving-incentivizations-of-waku-protocols","lvl":3,"i":2,"seen":0},{"content":"Devising novel applications of the Waku protocol stack","slug":"devising-novel-applications-of-the-waku-protocol-stack","lvl":3,"i":3,"seen":0},{"content":"Halo2 in a browser","slug":"halo2-in-a-browser","lvl":3,"i":4,"seen":0},{"content":"Meshnet transports and libp2p","slug":"meshnet-transports-and-libp2p","lvl":3,"i":5,"seen":0},{"content":"Applied ZK","slug":"applied-zk","lvl":3,"i":6,"seen":0},{"content":"Robust P2P network - NAT traversal","slug":"robust-p2p-network-nat-traversal","lvl":3,"i":7,"seen":0},{"content":"Peer scoring in peer-to-peer networks","slug":"peer-scoring-in-peer-to-peer-networks","lvl":3,"i":8,"seen":0},{"content":"Further Research Collaboration Opportunities","slug":"further-research-collaboration-opportunities","lvl":1,"i":9,"seen":0}]},"navProps":{"metadata":{"published":true,"title":"Open Research Problems"},"navOrder":1678965410.478,"localPath":"open-problems.md","path":["open-problems"],"children":[],"isDir":false},"routeParams":{"path":["open-problems"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
