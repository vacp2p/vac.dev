# Vac RFC Process

The Vac RFC unit serves as a vital cornerstone in the Logos collective,
taking on the responsibility of shepherding and editing [specifications](https://rfc.vac.dev/) for Logos projects and Vac incubator projects.
By meticulously crafting and overseeing these specifications, the Vac RFC unit acts as a linchpin for ensuring standardised and interoperable protocols within the Logos ecosystem.
Their expertise and attention to detail contribute to a cohesive and collaborative environment, facilitating seamless integration and advancement of decentralised technologies throughout the Logos collective and beyond.
