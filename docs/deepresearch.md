# Vac Deep Research

Vac Deep Research is at the forefront of cutting-edge exploration and innovation within the Logos collective.
Their work extends beyond scientific publications, actively bridging the gap between theory and practice.
The team collaborates with various entities, such as Vac R&D units, incubator projects, and Logos projects, to bring their research findings to fruition.
Part of this effort includes identifying opportunities for and spawning new incubator projects,
allowing Vac Deep Research to translate their research findings into practical applications within the Logos ecosystem.
Deep research encompasses several key areas, including Zero-Knowledge (ZK), Decentralized Privacy-preserving Node Provider Network, Validator privacy, and Libp2p Gossipsub Improvements.

## Zero Knowledge Proofs

In the realm of ZKP, Vac Deep Research has made contributions that have given rise to the [incubator projects](/vips) zkVM and RLNP2P.
The team delved into the intricacies of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, exploring their applications and pushing the boundaries of privacy-preserving technologies.
By advancing the field of ZK, Vac Deep Research strengthens the foundation for secure and confidential interactions within decentralized networks.

## Decentralized Privacy-preserving Node Provider Network

This research area focuses on the development of protocols and mechanisms that ensure privacy and security for both users and node providers, initially with a focus on Ethereum node providers.
This includes addressing concerns related to validator privacy.
The team also plans to extend their research to encompass Nomos.

## Libp2p Gossipsub Improvements

Another area of focus for Vac Deep Research is "libp2p gossipsub improvements".
The team explores ways to enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of the libp2p gossipsub protocol.
By conducting in-depth research and proposing improvements, Vac Deep Research aims to optimize information sharing and communication within decentralized networks,
contributing to the overall robustness and scalability of the P2P layers of Logos projects.
