## About Vac

Vac builds [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good) protocols for the decentralised web.
As an integral part of the [Logos collective](https://logos.co/),
Vac comprises [R&D Service Units](/vsus), [Incubator Projects](/vips), [Deep Research](/research), and the [RFC (specification) process](/rfcprocess) for Logos projects.
We do applied research based on which we build protocols, libraries, and publications. 
As custodians of these protocols, our aim is to adhere to [a set of principles](/principles) that ensure their alignment with our core values and objectives.

## Our principles

Liberty, censorship resistance, security, privacy, transparency, openness, decentralisation, inclusivity, continuance, resourcefulness.

These principles act as tools. Tools for thinking, for communication, and for decentralised decision making. They keep us honest about where we are falling short of our vision.

The meaning of these principles is elaborated on [here](/principles).
