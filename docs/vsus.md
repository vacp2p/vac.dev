# Vac R&D Service Units

Vac's R&D Service Units are integral to supporting [IFT](https://free.technology) projects by researching and developing base components
and secure, unbiased protocols.
They implement them in software artifacts like [nim-libp2p](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p) and [zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit).
These artifacts are designed to be readily usable by projects and accessible to the broader community beyond IFT.

In addition to developing these base components and protocols,
Vac R&D service units offer valuable expertise, resources, and technical guidance.
For instance, projects can outsource specific milestones to Vac units,
especially for components that might benefit multiple projects.
This approach allows for efficient resource allocation and knowledge sharing across the IFT ecosystem.

Furthermore, these units conduct applied research, spearheading exploration and cutting-edge innovation within the IFT.
Their primary focus is on researching topics that are practically relevant and directly helpful to projects.
This approach actively bridges the gap between theory and practice,
including identifying opportunities for and initiating new incubator projects.

Please find the Vac service units' roadmaps [here](https://roadmap.vac.dev/),
the weekly updates [here](https://roadmap.vac.dev/tags/vac-updates),
and our forum [here](https://forum.vac.dev/),
where we encourage you to engage in discussions about R&D topics across Vac, the entire IFT,
and the broader ecosystem beyond.

## P2P

The P2P service unit develops [nim-libp2p](https://github.com/status-im/nim-libp2p),
and works on improving libp2p protocols with a focus on gossipsub.
We prioritize requests for libp2p protocol improvements and nim-libp2p feature requests originating from IFT projects.

The P2P unit aims to optimise information sharing and communication within decentralised networks,
contributing to the overall robustness and scalability of the P2P layers of IFT projects.

## Token Economics (TKE)

The Vac Token Economics unit is dedicated to assisting IFT projects in designing their token economies, incentives, and markets.
TKE's collaboration with IFT project teams is intensive and occurs on a day-to-day basis,
where TKE not only responds to their needs but also proactively drives the conversation forward by suggesting new ideas and strategies
based on TKE's research.
The team brings together a broad spectrum of skills and knowledge, ranging from the modelling of dynamic systems to theoretical modelling
and general cryptoeconomics.

## Distributed Systems Testing (DST)

The Distributed Systems Testing (DST) R&D service unit is responsible for developing distributed systems testing software.
DST's primary objective is to assist IFT projects in understanding the scaling behaviour of their nodes within larger networks.
By conducting thorough regression testing, the DST unit helps identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues,
ensuring the reliability and stability of the projects.
The DST unit's expertise in distributed systems testing enables IFT projects to deliver scalable and resilient solutions that can withstand the demands of real-world decentralised applications.

## Quality Assurance (QA)

The QA Service Unit is dedicated to supporting IFT projects through the development and execution of comprehensive test plans.
Primary responsibilities include implementing unit tests and interoperability tests to ensure seamless integration and functionality across systems.

The QA unit plays a crucial role in the verification of project implementations.
By rigorously testing project implementations against defined specifications, QA ensures that all functionalities align with the project's requirements.
QA's proactive approach to identifying and reporting bugs ensures that any issues are addressed promptly, enhancing the overall quality and reliability of the software.
Through meticulous testing and quality assurance processes, the QA Service Unit ensures that IFT projects deliver robust and high-performing software solutions.

## Smart Contracts (SC)

Vac's Smart Contracts service unit specializes in developing, maintaining, and auditing smart contracts for IFT projects.
This unit ensures all smart contracts are robust, secure, and aligned with project requirements.
They enhance existing smart contracts and develop new ones using [Certora](https://www.certora.com/) formal verification rules,
a cutting-edge approach that mathematically proves contract adherence to intended specifications6.

The SC unit designs and implements smart contracts tailored to the unique needs of IFT projects,
guaranteeing they function as intended and remain current with evolving project requirements.
By leveraging tools like the Certora Prover, the team can detect rare and hard-to-find bugs,
providing the widest possible coverage for smart contract security.
This approach not only ensures the integrity of the contracts but also streamlines operations and reduces potential risks for IFT projects.

## Nim

With the IFT's extensive use of the [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/) ecosystem,
the Nim Service Unit focuses on the development and maintenance of Nim tooling and core libraries essential for IFT projects.
The Nim unit works on critical tools in the Nim ecosystem, including the Nim compiler, Nimble (package manager),
and nim-suggest, ensuring they are efficient, reliable, and up-to-date.
The Nim unit further plans to maintain core libraries developed by IFT, such as [Chronos](https://github.com/status-im/nim-chronos).
The mandate of the Nim unit also includes providing support to IFT projects regarding the use of Nim,
identifying and addressing specific project needs and demands related to the Nim ecosystem.

## Applied Cryptography & ZK (ACZ)

The Applied Cryptography & ZK (ACZ) R&D service unit works on cryptographic solutions,
zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs and argument systems, as well as network security protocols.
The unit mainly works on base components, protocols, and their implementations.
These include

* RLN ([RLNv1](https://rfc.vac.dev/vac/32/rln-v1), [RLNv2](https://rfc.vac.dev/vac/raw/rln-v2), [RLNv3](https://vac.dev/rlog/rln-v3)) and
* its backend implementation [zerokit](https://github.com/vacp2p/zerokit),
* a decentralised version of MLS,
* a libp2p-mix protocol,
* as well noise protocol channels and other cryptography-related aspects.

By leveraging state-of-the-art cryptographic and network security technologies, ACZ enhances the security, privacy, and trustworthiness of IFT projects,
contributing significantly to the integrity and resilience of the decentralized web ecosystem.
Research in ACZ has given rise to the [incubator project](/vips) Nescience.

## RFC

The Vac RFC unit serves as a vital cornerstone in the IFT,
taking on the responsibility of shepherding and editing [specifications](https://rfc.vac.dev/) for IFT projects.
By meticulously crafting and overseeing these specifications,
the Vac RFC unit acts as a linchpin for ensuring standardised and interoperable protocols within the IFT ecosystem
The RFC unit's expertise and attention to detail contribute to a cohesive and collaborative environment,
facilitating seamless integration and advancement of decentralised technologies
throughout the IFT and beyond.

## Security

The Vac Security service unit provides comprehensive support to IFT projects by conducting security audits
and helping develop robust security plans.
In addition to assisting IFT projects,
the security team also supports other IFT services by offering expert guidance on security best practices and risk management strategies.
This collaborative approach ensures that all aspects of the IFT ecosystem benefit from enhanced security measures.
By identifying potential vulnerabilities, assessing risks, and implementing effective security solutions tailored to specific needs,
the Vac Security service unit plays a crucial role in strengthening the overall security posture of IFT.
