# Vac Incubator Projects

Vac incubator projects are emerging initiatives that stem from Vac's [research](/research) efforts.
These projects are envisioned to eventually become separate IFT projects, benefiting from the support and resources of R&D Service Units within Vac.
The incubator projects operate within Vac, leveraging the expertise and collaboration available to them.

## Nescience

[Nescience](https://vac.dev/rlog/Nescience-state-separation-architecture) focuses on developing a state separation architecture.
It enables privacy-preserving computing, which holds significant importance for IFT programs, especially [Logos](https://logos.co/).
