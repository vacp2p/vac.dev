# Vac Incubator Projects

Vac incubator projects are emerging initiatives that stem from Vac's [deep research](/deepresearch) efforts.
These projects are envisioned to eventually become separate IFT projects, benefiting from the support and resources of both the Deep Research and R&D Service Units within Vac.
The incubator projects operate within Vac, leveraging the expertise and collaboration available to them.

## Nescience

[Nescience](https://vac.dev/rlog/Nescience-A-zkVM-leveraging-hiding-properties) focuses on developing a privacy-preserving general-purpose zero-knowledge virtual machine.
It enables privacy-preserving computing, which holds significant importance for IFT programs, especially [Logos](https://logos.co/).
