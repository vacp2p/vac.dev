Last updated: 9 February 2024

This Privacy Policy is intended to inform users of our approach to privacy in respect of this website (**"Website"**). In this regard, if you are visiting our Website, this Privacy Policy applies to you.

### 1) Who we are

For the purposes of this Privacy Policy and the collection and processing of personal data as a controller, the relevant entity is the Logos Collective Association, which has its registered office in Zug and its legal domicile address at

```
Logos Collective Association
c/o PST Consulting GmbH
Baarerstrasse 10
6300 Zug
Switzerland
```

Whenever we refer to “Logos”, “we” or other similar references, we are referring to the Logos Collective Association.

### 2) We limit the collection and processing of personal data from your use of the Website

We aim to limit the collection and collection and processing of personal data from users of the Website. We only collect and process certain personal data for specific purposes and where we have the legal basis to do so under applicable privacy legislation. We will not collect or process any personal data that we don’t need and where we do store any personal data, we will only store it for the least amount of time needed for the indicated purpose. 

In this regard, we collect and process the following personal data from your use of the Website:  

* **IP address**: As part of such use of the Website we briefly process your IP address but we have no way of identifying you. We however have a legitimate interest in processing such IP addresses to ensure the technical functionality and enhance the security measures of the Website. This IP address is not stored by us over time.

### 3) Third party processing of personal data

In addition to our limited and collection of personal data, third parties may collect or process personal data as a result of the Website making use of certain features or to provide certain content. To the extent you interact with such third party content or features, their respective privacy policies will apply. 

### 4) Security measures we take in respect of the Website 

As a general approach, we take data security seriously and we have implemented a variety of security measures on the Website to maintain the safety of your personal data when you submit such information to us. 

### 5) Exporting data outside the European Union and Switzerland

We are obliged to protect the privacy of personal data that you may have submitted in the unlikely event that we export your personal data to places outside the European Union or Switzerland. This means that personal data will only be processed in countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection as deemed by Switzerland or the European Commission. Otherwise, we will use other forms of protections, such as specific forms of contractual clauses to ensure such personal data is provided the same protection as required in Switzerland or Europe. In any event, the transmission of personal data outside the European Union and Switzerland will always occur in conformity with applicable privacy legislation. 


### 6) Your choices and rights

As explained in this Privacy Policy, we limit our collection and processing of your personal data wherever possible.

* Ask us to correct or update your personal data (where reasonably possible);

* Ask us to remove your personal data from our systems;

* Ask us for a copy of your personal data, which may also be transferred to another data controller at your request;
* Withdraw your consent to process your personal data (only if consent was asked for a processing activity), which only affects processing activities that are based on your consent and doesn’t affect the validity of such processing activities before you have withdrawn your consent;

* Object to the processing of your personal data; and

* File a complaint with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), if you believe that your personal data has been processed unlawfully.

### 7) Third party links

On this Website, you may come across links to third party websites. These third party sites have separate and independent privacy policies. We therefore have no responsibility or liability for the content and activities of these third party websites.
